# Daytona Proxy Samples

This repository provides sample implementations of proxy servers designed to handle Daytona sandbox traffic. These proxy servers can be customized with various features to enhance functionality and security.

## Overview

Daytona proxy servers act as intermediaries between clients and Daytona sandbox environments, allowing you to add custom functionality, monitoring, and control over the traffic flow. These samples demonstrate how to implement various proxy features that can be tailored to your specific requirements.

## Key Features

### üîß Custom Loaders
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Implement custom logic for loading and serving content
- **Resource Transformation**: Modify resources before they reach the sandbox
- **Conditional Loading**: Load different content based on specific conditions or rules

### üõ°Ô∏è Error Handlers
- **Graceful Error Management**: Custom error handling for various failure scenarios
- **Error Logging and Monitoring**: Track and log errors for debugging and analysis
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement fallback strategies when primary services fail
- **Custom Error Responses**: Provide meaningful error messages to clients

### üîê Authentication
- **Custom Authentication**: Implement your own authentication mechanisms
- **Token Validation**: Validate authentication tokens and credentials
- **Access Control**: Control access to specific resources or endpoints
- **Session Management**: Handle user sessions and state management

## Use Cases

- **Development Environments**: Customize proxy behavior for development workflows
- **Testing and QA**: Add monitoring and logging for testing purposes
- **Production Deployments**: Implement security and performance enhancements
- **Custom Integrations**: Add specific business logic or third-party integrations
